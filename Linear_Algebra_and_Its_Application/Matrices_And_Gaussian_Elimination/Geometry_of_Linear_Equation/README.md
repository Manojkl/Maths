# Geometry of linear equations

Given two equation and two unknown, find the value of the ubknwon.

Two equations <br>
2x - y = 1 <br>
x +y= 5 <br>

Ans: x = 2, y = 3

First approach

In the first form of equation the line passes through (2,3). The intersecting points between the two lines. Solving these equation by adding and subtracting leads us to (2,3).

Second approach involve column form of the equation. 
Column form is given by

$$
x*\left(\begin{array}{cc} 
2 \\
1 
\end{array}\right) + y*
\left(\begin{array}{cc} 
-1 \\ 
1 
\end{array}\right) = 
\left(\begin{array}{cc} 
1 \\ 
5 
\end{array}\right)

$$

The vectors (2,1) and (-1, 1) are represented by bold lines. The unknown are the numbers x and y that multiply the column vector. if we multiply 2 times the column 1 and 3 times the column 2 will result in parallelogram meeting at point (1, 5). Right side of the equation.

For a 3 variable equation lot of varities of data can be made. 

1. 2u + v + w = 5
2. 4u - 6v    = -2
3. -2u+7v+2w = 9

The first equation of plane meets the three cooridnates at (5/2, 0,0), (0,5,0), (0,0,5). 
If we multiply the right hand side 5 by 2, 2u +v +w = 10 will give a plane parallel to the first plane. If right hand side is zero then the plane goes through the origin.

Second equation is also a plane, even though the coefficients of w is zero. The second plane intersect with the first plane and the intersection is a line. 

The third plane intersect the first two planes at a point u = 1, v = 1, and w = 2. Thats is the solution of three equations.

n equations contains n unknwons.

 If time is the fourth dimension, then the plane t = 0 cuts throuth the four-dimensional space and produces the three-dimensional universe we live in. Another plane is z=0, which is also 3D.

First equation produces an (n-1) dimensional plane in n dimensions. And 2nd equation intersects and reduce the dimension by n-2 in n dimensions. Every equation reduces the dimensions, given they intersect.
